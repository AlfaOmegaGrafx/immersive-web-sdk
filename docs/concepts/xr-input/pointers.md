# Pointers (Canvas, Ray & Grab)

IWSDK uses pointer events as the common interaction path for browser canvas input and XR input. Browser mouse/touch events are forwarded from the renderer canvas when `input.canvasPointerEvents` is enabled, and XR uses a `MultiPointer` per hand for ray and grab interactions. Both paths dispatch Three/Object3D pointer events and drive ECS `Hovered` / `Pressed` tags for interactable entities.

## Concepts

- `CombinedPointer` routes events to whichever sub‑pointer is “active”.
- `CanvasPointerSystem` forwards DOM pointer events into the Three scene for browser 3D apps.
- Built‑ins:
  - `RayPointer` — uses the XR target ray to raycast your scene. Visualizes a beam and a 2D cursor that aligns to surface normals.
  - `GrabPointer` — anchored at the grip space for near interactions (e.g., grabbing widgets at your hand).
- Event mapping from `StatefulGamepad`:
  - `select` → ray pointer (button 0)
  - `squeeze` → grab pointer (button 2)

## Using the multipointer

```ts
const mpLeft = world.input.xr.multiPointers.left;
const mpRight = world.input.xr.multiPointers.right;

// Toggle built‑ins
mpLeft.toggleSubPointer('ray', true);
mpLeft.toggleSubPointer('grab', true);

// Make grab the default target for generic events
mpLeft.setDefault('grab');

// Check if ray is currently targeting something
if (mpRight.getRayBusy()) {
  // show a tooltip, etc.
}
```

You normally don’t need to call `update` — `world.input.xr` drives both multipointers each frame, enabling them only when a gamepad is present on the primary source.

## Making objects interactive

`@pmndrs/pointer-events` augments Three.js with pointer events. Assign handlers to your meshes/materials; browser canvas pointers and XR ray/grab pointers will dispatch to them.

```ts
import { Mesh, MeshStandardMaterial, BoxGeometry } from 'three';

const button = new Mesh(
  new BoxGeometry(0.1, 0.02, 0.1),
  new MeshStandardMaterial({ color: '#3355ff' }),
);
button.position.set(0, 1.4, -0.6);

// Handlers use the pointer-events event model
(button as any).onPointerEnter = () =>
  (button.material as any).emissive?.set('#2233aa');
(button as any).onPointerLeave = () =>
  (button.material as any).emissive?.set('#000000');
(button as any).onClick = () => console.log('Clicked by pointer');
scene.add(button);
```

The `RayPointer` uses an optimized raycaster (`firstHitOnly = true`) for BVH‑accelerated scenes. Browser canvas events use the same interactable target lists maintained by `InputSystem`, so `RayInteractable` means "selectable by a pointer/ray" rather than "XR only."

## Browser canvas pointers

Canvas pointer forwarding is enabled by default:

```ts
const world = await World.create(container, {
  xr: false,
  input: {
    canvasPointerEvents: true,
  },
});
```

Use `canvasPointerEvents: { activeDuringXR: true }` only when you intentionally want mouse/touch events on the mirror canvas during an immersive session. The default is to pause browser canvas forwarding while XR is active so it does not interfere with controller or hand input.

## Visual policy (ray + cursor)

The ray visual follows a simple policy:

- If the ray pointer has capture → show ray, hide cursor.
- If any non‑ray pointer has capture → hide ray and cursor.
- Otherwise → show both when intersecting.

This reduces clutter when, e.g., your grab pointer is manipulating something.

## Custom pointers

You can build and register your own `Pointer` (from `@pmndrs/pointer-events`). Register with `CombinedPointer.register(pointer, isDefault)` and keep a reference to unregister later.

```ts
import { CombinedPointer, createPointer } from '@pmndrs/pointer-events';

const myPointer = createPointer(/* your spatial transform source */);
const unregister = (world.input.xr as any).multiPointers.left[
  'combined'
].register(myPointer, false);
// later
unregister();
```

Tip: Mirror how `RayPointer` constructs its pointer — it supplies a camera getter and a `{ current: Group }` for the space whose world transform you want to use.

## Troubleshooting

- No browser click events: confirm `input.canvasPointerEvents` is enabled and the object has an interactable component.
- No XR click events: ensure the primary input source on that side has a gamepad (some hand‑tracking runtimes don’t). The multipointer enables only when connected.
- Cursor misaligned on slanted surfaces: confirm surface normals make sense in object space; the ray visual converts them to world space via the normal matrix.
